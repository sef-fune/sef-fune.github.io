        <div id="pan"> <p> "i think the pandemic made me feel more lonely due to a lack of contact with friends and a place i can escape to. i feel confined in this house, which isn't a bad thing, but it just feels bland. it's like all the days just blend together and i don't know when it will end." </p> </div> 
      
        <h2 id="thepan"> Student from Stella Maris </h2> <! ryn -->

        <h2 id="thepan"> Anika Beatrize Panopio (B2024) </h2> <! bea --> 
        <div id="pan"> <p> "ako, personally, i imporved here at home... mas hiyang ako dito and i was able to manage my time more wisely. i guess you could say my mental health got a bit better? but to be honest, i'd say i've become a better person. nakapagreflect ako and i never really had backlogs or crammed any requirements. </p></div> 
      
        <h2 id="thepan"> Student from PSHS - Main Campus </h2> <! lrn --> 
        <div id="pan"> <p> "ig the biggest thing that happened since the pandemic is suddenly having to fill the void caused by isolation ?? like i don't have people to hug and talk to anymore so it kinda led to me trying to pass the time through self reflection and i,,, have been reconsidering a Lot of stuff while missing people" </p></div>
